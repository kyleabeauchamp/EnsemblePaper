The advantages of the present approach are fivefold.  First, we focus on equilibrium experimental measurements, such as chemical shifts and scalar couplings.  Such experiments are straightforward to perform and interpret.  Chemical shifts in particular are the most widely-acquired NMR observable.  Although chemical shift modeling has previously been demonstrated \cite{shen2008consistent} in the context of structure prediction, the current work uses chemical shifts (and scalar couplings) to estimate conformational ensembles.  Second, previous ensemble studies have focused on point estimates of ensembles \cite{rozycki2011saxs, lindorff2005simultaneous, lange2008recognition}, whereas we demonstrate Bayesian inference of conformational ensembles--allowing rigorous estimates of equilibrium and structural properties and their associated uncertainties.  Third, although other Bayesian ensemble inference techniques have been described \cite{fisher2010}, the current work demonstrates a new approach to reducing the size of the parameter space.  Fourth, BELT models are robust to the initial force field.  This is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, that simulation-based models can make robust predictions that are not biased by force field inaccuracy.  Finally, we have implemented our methods in a fully-documented, open-source library (FitEnsemble: \url{https://github.com/kyleabeauchamp/FitEnsemble}), which will be of use to researchers in the field.
